### Predicting Cancer Types using Machine Learning README  [Submitted by Dronesh Magare21IM30013]

## Introduction: 
This README explains how to execute the code for the "Predicting Cancer Types Using Machine Learning" assignment. The code is developed in Python v3.11.0, although for compatibility, Python >=3.10 is suggested.
  
## Prerequisites:  
Check that you have the necessary libraries installed before running the code. You can accomplish this by entering the following command into your terminal:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
This command will install all of the prerequisites indicated in '''requirements.txt''.

### Project Structure
Check that the '''data''' folder is in the same directory as the notebook assignment2. The folder structure should be as follows:

Asgn2_21IM30013/  
    ├── AMLBS Assignment 2.ipynb  
    ├── data/  
    │   ├── ...  
    │   └── ...  
    └── requirements.txt  

### Running the Code
You can run the code by opening the '''AMLBS Assignment 2.ipynb''' notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python IDE of your choice after installing the relevant libraries and organizing your project structure as mentioned above.
